Welcome to the Ball In Hole app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Adem İlisu. The source code is available on GitHub; the app is also available on Google Play.

I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge. I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Adem İlisu.
